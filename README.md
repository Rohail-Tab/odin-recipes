# odin-recipes
This project is the first one I am doing from The Odin Project.
This project is about some recipes of delicious food.(I Think!) This is written at the very start of project.

So used my HTML knowledge to complete this project.
Main elements used are header, paragraph, image and list.

Made an index page and three seperate pages for recipes.

Used Git extensively. 
Main Commands used are git clone, git add, git commit and git push origin main.

Had Fun.!!!
